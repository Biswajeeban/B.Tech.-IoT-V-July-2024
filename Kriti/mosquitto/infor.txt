The mosquitto server is downloaded and implemented in the UNIX terminal of my laptop.

There are 3 photos of which 1 of each represent the part of an mqtt (a broker and client(subscriber and publisher )):
1. Start the mosquitto server by the typing the code [brew services start mosquitto].
2. in another terminal we made a subcriber to the [lab_example] topic using the code [mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t lab_example]
3. in another terminal i made a publisher to the topic [lab_example] using [mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t lab_example -m "\\I am a publisher to this topic\\"]
4. stop the server with the code [brew services stop mosquitto]

## We can also allow subscriber to subcribe to our topic using our network .
