Q. Explain basic struture of arduino program ?
Ans:-- 	Arduino program used GCC based compiler and mainly consist of 2 main function :-
	1. void setup() :- 
		where the code is run only one time when the program start running , it is where 
	all the variable set up are keep .
	2. void loop() :-- 
		this part of the code runs infinetely till the power is on or available 

 Example of blinking of an led :- 
  
  // Here we can include the header for the types of project we are working on 
  // #include<dhtt11.h> - this is for working with dhtt11 sensor
  // also we can define the macro program that need to be initialised before the program compile
  // define ()
  etc...

  void setup(){
	pinMode(LED_BUILTIN , OUTPUT);
  }
  
  void loop(){
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); // This turn on the light
	delay(1000); // the light is on for 1sec i.e 1000 ms 
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // This turn off the light
	delay(1000); // the light is off for 1sec i.e 1000 ms 
  }
