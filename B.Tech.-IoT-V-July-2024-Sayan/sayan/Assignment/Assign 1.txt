1. What is a Prototype? What are Open source and closed source prototype platforms?
> A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process. 
 It is a preliminary version from which other forms are developed. 
 Prototypes are used to evaluate a new design to enhance precision by system analysts and users.
- Open Source Prototype Platforms: These platforms have their design, software, and specifications publicly available. 
  This allows users to modify, distribute, and use the designs without restriction. Examples include Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
- Closed Source Prototype Platforms: These platforms keep their design, software, and specifications proprietary. 
  Users cannot legally modify or share the design. An example is the BASIC Stamp microcontroller by Parallax.

2. What is Arduino?
> Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.
  It consists of a microcontroller, an integrated development environment (IDE), and a standard programming language. 
  Arduino boards are capable of reading inputs – light on a sensor, a finger on a button, 
  or a Twitter message – and turning it into an output – activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
