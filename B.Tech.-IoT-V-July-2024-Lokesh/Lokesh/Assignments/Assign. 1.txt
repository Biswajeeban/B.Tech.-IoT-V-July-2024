1.	Prototype? Open-Source and Closed-Source Prototype Platforms:
A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process. 

		Open-source: Open source is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution. 
E.g. Arduino, Raspberry Pi.
		Closed-source: Closed-source model source code is not released to the public, i.e. it is not available on the public domains. 
E.g. Google Earth, Skype, WinRAR, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS
2.	Arduino?
Arduino is a small popular electronic machine that makes it very easy for people to make electronic things.
It has two parts: 
		a Circuit Board
		a program that lets people tell the circuit board what to do.
3.	Arduino Uno R3 Key Specifications:
		Main Processor
		•	ATmega328P, a modified Harvard architecture 8-bit RISC* processor core. *Reduced Instruction Set Computer
		Memory (SRAM, FLASH MEMORY, EEPROM)
		•	SRAM: Static Random Access Memory a type of RAM which uses a flip-flop to store 1-bit of data.
				The system's temporary data or run-time data is stored in the SRAM; with a size of 2KB.
		•	FLASH MEMORY: In Arduino, the Flash stores the application code to be run.
				The Size of Flash Memory is 32KB.
		•	EEPROM: An Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory. It is a form of non-volatile memory that can remember things with the power being turned off, or after resetting the Arduino. 
				The Size of EEPROM is 1KB.
	
		I/O Pins
		•	An Arduino has 14 digital input/output pins (of which 6 can be used as PWM* outputs), 6 analog inputs.
