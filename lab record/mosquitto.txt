The mosquitto server is downloaded and implemented in the Ubuntu terminal of my laptop.

There are 3 photos of which 1 of each represent the part of an mqtt (a broker and client(subscriber and publisher )):
1. Start the mosquitto server by the typing the code [sudo mosquitto].
2. in another terminal we made a subcriber to the [test] topic using the code [mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test]
3. in another terminal i made a publisher to the topic [test] using [mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test -m "Hello"]

## We can also allow subscriber to subcribe to our topic using our network .
