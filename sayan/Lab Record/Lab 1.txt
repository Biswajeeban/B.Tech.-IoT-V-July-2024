Lab Exercise: Blinking the In-Built LED

Step 1: Connect and Set Up the Arduino
1.	Connect the Arduino to Your Computer: Use a USB cable to connect the Arduino board to your computer. The Arduinoâ€™s onboard LED is connected to pin 13, so no external components are required.
2.	Open the Arduino IDE: Launch the Arduino IDE on your computer.

Step 2: Write the Code
1.	Open a New Sketch: In the Arduino IDE, open a new sketch by going to File > New.
2.	Enter the Code: Type the following code, which will turn the LED on and off at one-second intervals:

void setup() { 
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000); 
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}







Step 3: Select the Board and Port
1.	Choose the Board: Go to Tools > Board and select your Arduino model (e.g., Arduino Uno).
2.	Select the Port: Go to Tools > Port and choose the port your Arduino is connected to. This is usually labeled with "Arduino" and a COM number (e.g., COM3 on Windows or /dev/cu.usbmodem on macOS).

Step 4: Upload the Code
1.	Verify the Code: Click the Verify button (the checkmark icon) to compile the code and check for any errors.
2.	Upload the Code: Click the Upload button (the right-arrow icon) to upload the code to your Arduino.

Step 5: Observe the In-Built LED Blinking
Once the upload is complete, the onboard LED should start blinking on and off every second. The LED will turn on for one second, then off for one second, in a continuous loop.
