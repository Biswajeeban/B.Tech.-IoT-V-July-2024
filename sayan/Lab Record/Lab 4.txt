Lab 4: Using Mosquitto MQTT (Pub-Sub):

Step 1: Installing and Configuring Mosquitto as an MQTT Broker
1.	Download and Install Mosquitto:
o	Go to the official Mosquitto download page.
o	Download the Windows installer and run the installation.
o	During installation, Mosquitto will be added as a Windows service, allowing it to run in the background automatically.
2.	Add Mosquitto to the System PATH:
o	Open System Properties and go to Environment Variables.
o	Locate and edit the Path variable to include C:\Program Files\mosquitto.
o	Adding Mosquitto to the PATH allows you to run mosquitto commands directly from the Command Prompt.
3.	Starting and Stopping Mosquitto as a Service:
o	To start Mosquitto manually, open Command Prompt with administrator privileges and enter:
bash
net start mosquitto
o	To stop the service, run:
bash
net stop mosquitto
4.	Running Mosquitto with Verbose Logging:
o	Navigate to the Mosquitto installation directory to start the broker with verbose logging:
bash
Copy code
cd "C:\Program Files\mosquitto"
mosquitto.exe -v
o	The -v flag provides detailed output on the broker’s activities, which is useful for debugging.






	In Linux [ WSL*: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ]:
	-  In Terminal > wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04 > \ E / N \ T / E \ R /
	- Restart the machine, and Launch Ubuntu 22.04
		- $sudo apt update 
		- $sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients
	Starting mosquitto services:
		- $sudo systemctl ( enable /start ) mosquitto

	Mosquitto Broker Service Status can be checked here:
		- $sudo systemctl status mosquitto


	- Once verified service status, transmission can be carried on.
	Stopping mosquitto services:
		- $sudo systemctl stop mosquitto



Step 2: Setting Up Publisher and Subscriber (Pub/Sub) on Windows
1.	Open Command Prompt:
o	After adding Mosquitto to the PATH, open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window to run MQTT commands.
2.	Start a Subscriber:
o	The subscriber will listen to a topic for messages. In the Command Prompt, enter:
bash
Copy code
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "test/topic"
o	Here, -h localhost specifies the broker’s address (your local machine) and -t "test/topic" specifies the topic to subscribe to.
3.	Start a Publisher:
o	Open another Command Prompt window, and enter:
bash
Copy code
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test/topic" -m "Hello MQTT"
o	This command sends the message "Hello MQTT" to the test/topic. Any subscribers to this topic will receive the message.

Step 3: Accessing Mosquitto Broker from a Linux Environment
1.	Locate the IP Address of Your Windows Machine:
o	Find your machine’s IP by running the following command in Command Prompt:
ipconfig
Note the IP address under your network connection (usually 192.168.x.x).
Connect to the Broker from Linux:
In a Linux environment with Mosquitto installed, use the mosquitto_sub and mosquitto_pub commands to connect to the broker running on your Windows machine.
To subscribe, use:
mosquitto_sub -h <Windows_IP> -t "test/topic"
o	To publish a message from Linux to the Windows broker:
mosquitto_pub -h <Windows_IP> -t "test/topic" -m "Hello from Linux"
o	Replace <Windows_IP> with your Windows machine’s IP address.

Step 4: Testing and Troubleshooting
•	Verify Broker Activity:
o	In the Command Prompt on your Windows machine, use mosquitto.exe -v to view incoming connections, message activity, and potential issues.
•	Firewall Considerations:
o	Ensure that your Windows firewall allows connections on port 1883, the default port for MQTT. Configure this by adding a firewall rule for the Mosquitto executable or allowing inbound connections on port 1883.

	Testing MQTT Services [ Message Transmission: WinOS11 + Ubuntu 22.04 ]:
	- Open 2 Terminals:
		# 1st: mosquitto_sub.exe -h localhost -t test/topic



	# 2nd: mosquitto_pub.exe -h localhost -t test/topic -m " Light was here! "
