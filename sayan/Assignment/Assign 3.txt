Explain Basic Structure of an Arduino Program.

An Arduino program (often called a "sketch") has a basic structure that consists of two main functions: setup() and loop(). Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the basic structure:

Basic Structure
1.	Global Variables (Optional): Define variables used throughout the sketch.

        int sensorValue = 0;


2.	setup() Function: Runs once at the start to initialize settings.

        void setup() { 
        pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); 
        Serial.begin(9600); }



3.	loop() Function: Runs repeatedly to execute the main logic.

        void loop() { 
        sensorValue = analogRead(A0); 
        Serial.println(sensorValue); 
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH); delay(1000);
        digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); delay(1000); }
