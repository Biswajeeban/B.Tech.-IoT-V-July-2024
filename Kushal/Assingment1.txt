1. What is a Prototype? What are Open source and closed source prototype platforms?

A prototype is an early sample, model, or product release used to test a concept or method. It is a prototype version from which subsequent forms are created. System analysts and users utilize prototypes to test a new design and improve precision. - Open Source Prototype systems: These systems' designs, software, and specifications are all publicly available. This enables people to alter, share, and utilize the designs without restriction. Arduino and Raspberry Pi are few examples. - Closed Source Prototype Platforms: These platforms keep their design, software, and specs confidential. Users are not permitted to legally change or share the design. One example is Parallax's BASIC Stamp microcontroller.

2. What is Arduino?

Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It consists of a microcontroller, an integrated development environment (IDE), and a standard programming language. Arduino boards are capable of reading inputs – light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message – and turning it into an output – activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online.
