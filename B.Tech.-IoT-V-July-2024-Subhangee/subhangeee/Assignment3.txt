Q. Explain Basic Structure of an Arduino Program.

Ans. An Arduino program has a basic structure that consists of two main functions: 
setup() and loop(). But there is also header for importing library and macro definition . 

Basic Structure
1. setup() Function: Runs once at the start to initialize settings.

 eg:- void setup() {
	pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
	}

2. loop() Function: Runs repeatedly to execute the main logic.

eg :- void loop() { 
	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
	delay(1000);
 	digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN,LOW);
	delay(1000);
}

The above example is for blinking of an builtin led for 1 second of on and off.
