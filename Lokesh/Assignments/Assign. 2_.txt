What is an Encoding format? List down encoding formats for various types of data  ( Text, Number, Photo, Audio, Video ).

~ Encoding Formats: A Brief Overview ~ 
	Encoding format is essentially a standardized method to translate data into a format that computers can understand and process efficiently. It's like converting human language into 	a language computers can comprehend.

Different Encoding Formats:
	Text Encoding
		Text data is represented by characters, which are assigned specific numerical values. These values are then stored and transmitted in a specific format.

	- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange): Represents 128 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, punctuation, and control characters.
	- Unicode: A more comprehensive character encoding standard, capable of representing text in almost all languages. It includes ASCII as a subset.
	- UTF-8: A variable-length encoding scheme compatible with ASCII, widely used for web pages and email.
	
	Number Encoding
		Numbers are represented digitally using different numerical systems.

	- Binary: Uses only 0s and 1s.
	- Decimal: The base-10 system we commonly use.
	- Hexadecimal: Uses 16 digits (0-9, A-F).
	- Floating-point: Represents real numbers with a decimal point.
	
	Image Encoding
		Images are represented by pixels, each with color information.

	- JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): Lossy compression, suitable for photographs.
	- PNG (Portable Network Graphics): Lossless compression, suitable for images with sharp edges and text.
	- GIF (Graphics Interchange Format): Supports animation and transparency, often used for simple images and logos.
	- BMP (Bitmap): Uncompressed format, large file size.
	- TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): Lossless compression, supports various image depths.
	
	Audio Encoding
		Audio data is represented by digital samples of sound waves.

	- MP3: Lossy compression, widely used for music.
	- AAC (Advanced Audio Coding): Lossy compression, often used in iTunes and digital broadcasting.
	- WAV (Waveform Audio File): Lossless compression, high-quality audio format.
	- FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec): Lossless compression, maintains audio quality.

	Video Encoding
		Video data combines image and audio data.

	- MP4 (MPEG-4 Part 14): Commonly used for video storage and distribution.
	- AVI (Audio Video Interleave): Container format supporting various codecs.
	- MOV (QuickTime Movie): Apple's video format.
	- WMV (Windows Media Video): Microsoft's video format.
