# üçû Breadboard? üõπ

_____________________________________________________________________

A **`breadboard`** is a tool used for _prototyping_ and _testing_ **electronic circuits** w/o soldering.

> It's a _plastic board_ with _many small holes_ that allow you to easily insert electronic components like resistors, LEDs, transistors, etc.

> The holes are **connected in groups**, making it _easy to create_ connections between different components.

## How Breadboards Work

- **Conductive Strips:** Inside the breadboard, there are metal strips that connect the holes in rows and columns.
- **Rows:** Each row of `5 holes` is electrically connected, forming a single node.
- **Columns:** Each column of `5 holes` is electrically connected, forming a single node.
- **Power Rails:** Breadboards usually have two long rows of holes on the sides labeled:
    - "**Power**" or, [ _`+ve`_ ] üî¥
    - "**Ground**" or, "**GND**" üîµ
    > _These are used to connect a power source (like a battery) to the circuit._

## Basic Usage

- **Insert Components:** The leads of components like resistors or LEDs are pushed into the holes of the breadboard.
- **Make Connections:** Male2Male jumper wires are used to connect the components together.
- **Power the Circuit:** The power rails are connected to a power source using the jumper wires.

## Tips for Using Breadboards

- **Planning Our Layout**: Our circuit is first sketched out on paper before building it on the breadboard, for better understanding the connections.
- **Starting Simple:** We need to begin with small circuits to get comfortable with the concept.
- **Being Careful with Power:** We must avoid exceeding the voltage and current ratings of the components.

## Miscellaneous üçûüõπ

- **Breadboard Sizes**: Breadboards come in various sizes, with the most common being the "half-size" breadboard.
- **Component Placement**: Components can be placed in any row or column as long as the connections are correct.
- **Jumper Wires**: These are essential for making connections between components and the power rails.
- **Power Supply**: We'll need a suitable power supply (like a battery or power adapter) to provide power to your circuit.
