1. What is a Prototype?
A prototype is an early model of a product used to test ideas and make improvements before final production.

Open Source Prototype Platforms: These are platforms with freely available source code, like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, where you can modify and share the code.
Closed Source Prototype Platforms: These are proprietary systems with restricted access to the source code, such as some commercial development kits.

2. What is Arduino?
Arduino is an open-source electronics platform that lets you build interactive projects. It consists of a microcontroller board and a software environment to program it, making it accessible for hobbyists and students.
